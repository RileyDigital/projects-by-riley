# Quantum Threat Analysis Report

Type: University Research Project  
Role: Analyst & Documentation Lead  
Grade: High Distinction   
Course: COIT13236 Cyber Security Project (Final Year Project)  

## Overview
This project presents a detailed threat analysis focused on the impact of quantum computing on modern cryptographic systems. It evaluates vulnerabilities in RSA and ECC, identifies potential attack vectors, and assesses long-term data risks through harvest now, encrypt later scenarios. 

This report is part of a broader research project on Enhancing Cybersecurity with Post-Quantum Cryptography, exploring both theoretical and practical mitigations against emerging quantum threats. 

## Key Objectives
- Assess how quantum algorithms (e.g., Shor's, Grover's) threat classical cryptography.
- Identify high-risk sectors and data categories susceptible to future decryption.
- Evaluate post-quantum (PQC) alternatives.
- Produce a comprehensive Quantum Threat Assessment, Long-term Data Risk Evaluation, Evaluating Alternate PQC Algorithms, PQC Transition Justification and a Threat Modelling Report.

## My Contributions
- Authored the entire Threat Analysis Report.
- Conducted literature review and integrated findings from NIST SP 800-82 Rev. 3.
- Performed comparative analysis of traditional vs. post-quantum algorithms.
- Structured and formatted final technical report

## Tools & Techniques
- NIST PQC candidate research (Kyber, Dilithium, Falcon, etc.).
- Quantum risk modelling using Microsoft Threat Modelling Tool.
- Git for version control and collaborative editing.
