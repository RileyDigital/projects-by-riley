# Sysadmin Assignment Scripts
This folder contains the scripts developed as part of my Sysadmin Final Assignment. They demonstrate automation, backup, and security auditing skills. 

## Scripts
- 'full-backup.sh' - Automates backups of servers and generates timestamped file lists with owner information.
- 'rocky-firewall-rules.sh' - Configures iptables rule to secure the internal network while allowing necessary traffic.
- 'ssh-audit.sh' - Monitors SSH login attempts and generates user-friendly summaries. Optionally blocks suspicious IPs.

## Important Notes
- These scripts are provided for portfolio demonstration only and are not a complete turnkey solution.
- Running them outside the context of the full network design described in the main project documentation will likely fail.
